  If it's a topic that matters then I'm sure to comment on it here. If it is
  something I believe strongly about, you will read it here. I believe I'm fair,

  about others. My passions in life are Helping Others, Photography, Spreading
  Unconditional Love, Politics, Technology, LGBTQ Issues, Communications,
  Emergency Services, and being an Entrepreneur. But not necessarily in that
  same order.
