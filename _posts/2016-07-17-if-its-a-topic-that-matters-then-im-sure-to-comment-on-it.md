Imagine if we all practiced unconditional love towards each other and random acts of kindness!

If it's a topic that matters then I'm sure to comment on it here. If it is something I believe strongly about, you will read it here. I believe I'm fair, accurate, educated, honest, modest, concerned and someone who truly cares about others. My passions in life are Helping Others, Photography, Spreading _Unconditional _Love, Politics, Technology, LGBTQ Issues, Communications, Emergency Services, and being an Entrepreneur. But not necessarily in that same order.
